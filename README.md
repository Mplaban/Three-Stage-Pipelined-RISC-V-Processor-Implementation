# Three-Stage-Pipelined-RISC-V-Processor-Implementation
• The project is aimed to implement RISC V processor using 3-stage pipelining and write appropriate testbench to check the working of the processor.
• The ISA implemented is RV32I. The type of instructions implemented are R-Type, I-type(load and immediate arithmetic) and B-Type.
• The three stages implemented are Instruction Fetch & decode, Execution and Memory-Write back.
• The software used is Xilinix-Vivado and language used is Verilog
